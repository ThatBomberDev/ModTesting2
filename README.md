# NoMansSky Logic Based Mod Testing

## Goals
• Testing new API features to get a sense of usage. <br>
• Implementing new mod ideas and playtesting before creating an independent mod. <br>
• Create a sort of "Mod-Pack" of tested, untested and unreleased features and ideas as an experimental ground for public usage as an example and a jumping groujd to create new ideas. <br>
• Acting as an alternate source of examples for new users. <br>
